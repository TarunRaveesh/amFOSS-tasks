## The About

Hello! I'm Tarun, a Computer Software cum Hardware enthusiast 👨🏻‍💻, I’ve always had passion for Computers and Tech, I love this stuff...!! Anyways we'll get to that but let me introduce myself first. So, I come from Andhra Pradesh but I've hardly lived there as my dad works in the Indian Airforce owing to which I've resided at many places in India and know quite a few languages too 😏. Now, first let me make it clear that I’m a complete newbie here💀, although my interest in Computer Science started in 6th grade when dad got me a second-hand Ubuntu CPU which was then connected to our 32-inch LCD as a monitor 😂, yeah that was my first PC. So, it all started with installing cracked games, patching software, activating Windows using googled CMD commands 😅, and lol I also remember converting my Win 7 Pro (SP1) to a Win 7 Ultimate with a couple of restarts … Also, when I got a laptop (it was a Pavilion g6, bought it after casting out that CPU 🙄) I was so curious about its hardware interior that there are many instances when I dismantled it without the knowledge of my parents and also did manage to successfully damage it once 😬, well it turns out that was surely worth it. But along the years, I didn’t have much exposure to all the awesome stuff I've been doing lately, and due to that pathetic JEE Coaching stuff 😶I had to cease my practice of learning stuff on computers and open source as I joined a hostel where even keypad phones weren’t allowed and thus don’t have any prior knowledge in Computer Languages. Well anyway, to look on the bright side I’m out of it and now have this wonderful opportunity of Joining this Club to enhance and showcase my skills in the best of ways possible. So yeah, I’m looking forward to it….
