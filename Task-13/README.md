## Task 13 - Circuit Design
This task was fun, as I do tend be a hardware freak ðŸ˜Œ. I keep tinkering with a lot of stuff but as I didn't have any prior experience with Arduino, a couple of youtube tutorials got me up and going. I chose to use a **Peizo Buzzer** to notify the user of the obstacle.

Here is my Circuit Design:

### Case 1 - At Rest

### Case 2 - Distance > 100

The Motor is working and the Buzzer is silent.

### Case 3 - Distance < 100

The Motor stops and and the Buzzer starts buzzing.
