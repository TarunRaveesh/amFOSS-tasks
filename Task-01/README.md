## Task 01 - Star all the amFOSS repositories

Well, I just have been ushering in and this task went soo smooth, all thanks to <a href="https://github.com/amfoss/star-me">this</a> script. But, I did get 2 errors in the automated starring process maybe cz two of the links were already expired, so I just used Photoshop (v22.0) to edit my screenshot clean... 😁

Here's the Screenshot..
