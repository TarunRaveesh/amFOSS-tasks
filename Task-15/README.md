## Task 15 - Project Euler
Just some basic maths. I did get some Timeout Errors with some of my codes mainly the 4th one but then I figured out a palindrome is supposedly a multiple of 11 and used it to reduce a few iterations for the loops. The other problems were just fine and using Python made it a lot more easier.
