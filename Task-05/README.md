## Task 05 - Rustic Scraper
This task was interesting. The given documentation were pretty much useful. Also I referred this <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">Rust Documentation</a> to get a bit versed with the Rust Language. But yes finding the CSS Selector was a headache for fetching the Table and it's contents. I used a handy web app called <a href="https://selectorgadget.com/">Selector Gadget</a> and things were fine.
