## Task 14 - Bandit

Bandit was real fun.. 
I did this task in Ubuntu and learnt many new commands for the terminal...

I completed until the 10th level and learnt various commands on browsing through filesystems and managing data; but I am going to continue doing the further levels after tasks submission..

The Paswords of Various levels are stored in the respective folders :)
