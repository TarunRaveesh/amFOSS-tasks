# Introspection

### a) Why must we choose you?
I am somebody who has been passionate about coding and computing since a long time, but never got a right oppertunity or source to fulfill that zeal of mine. I have been longing for something exactly like this, and really intend to utilize it finally. I'm a decently fast learner and really want to rightfully avail everything that this awesome club of brilliant people has to offer. I'd like to emphasize that whatever I do, I try to do it with humility which keeps me motivated, dedicated and causious at the same time. Also I plausibily am an extrovert, so would mingle with people nicely, hence hoping to learn and exchange different ideologies. And like to be bluntly honest, I'd just say that I really am in utter need of this fantastic platform as I am not having a CS back-ground and want to learn all the awesome stuff under the guidance of a legit community like amFOSS.

### b) What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
I guess none! I usually don't go with future plans. I am to do whatever I could do now; and that's basically because I really can't predict what all the future has to offer, given that everything's going to be pretty much new and hopefully awesome I would rather strive to put my best in whatever I do and keep up to the expectations of people around, who heve been trusting and supporting me. 

### c) How would you contribute back to the club?
As stated above, I really think I would be a nice and apt addition to the already wonderful team of versatile people, I'll try and put my best to keep up the quality of the club. Also, I think I explain stuff well, and have also helped out people with these tasks as far as I could. Hence, I want to make this habit of exchanging thoughts and ideas a common parctice, promoting interaction and productivity at the same time. I basically want to convey, that if I hopefully happen to join the club I will surely try and be a great team member.

### d) Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Well, even if I have had suggestions, I think I don't happen to be the right person to comment upon stuff that I really am not exposed into. I'd rather say all of u people have done a great job in guiding, inspiring and supporting us. I'd surely think of suggestions if I become eligibe enough to be in your respective places. Until then I could just hope to get into the Club.

                                                                  Thanks for all the help!!! - (Regards to the Concerned)
