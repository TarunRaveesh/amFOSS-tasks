# Introspection

### a) Why must we choose you?
* I am somebody who has been passionate about coding and computing all along and the Club seems like a perfect place to get started with. I'm a decently fast learner and want to rightfully avail everything that this awesome club of brilliant people has to offer. I'd like to emphasize that whatever I do, I try to do it with humility which keeps me motivated, dedicated and causious at the same time. Also I plausibily am an extrovert, so would mingle with people nicely, and am hoping to learn and exchange different ideologies thoughout. Also I don't want to miss out on this fantastic platform as I am not having a CS back-ground and would want to learn everything I possibly could under the guidance of a legit community like amFOSS.

### b) What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
* I guess none! I usually don't go with future plans. I am to do whatever I could do now; and that's basically because I really can't predict what all the future has to offer, given that everything's going to be pretty much new and hopefully awesome I would rather strive to put my best in whatever I do. But well, I do plan on learning a lot of things that I sure am not even aware of right now.

### c) How would you contribute back to the club?
* As stated above, I'll put my best to be an apt addition to this club of versatile people, and will work to cope up with the quality of the club. Being an extrovet, interacting with people is easier for me and have also helped out people with these tasks as far as I could. Hence, I want to make this habit of exchanging thoughts and ideas a common parctice. I'll be a good team member after I join the club.

### d) Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
* Well, even if I have had suggestions, I think I don't happen to be the right person to comment upon stuff that I really am not exposed into. I'd rather say all of u people have done a great job in guiding and supporting us. I'll come up with suggestions if I become eligibe enough to be in your respective places. Until then, I'm better off being a learner of sorts.

                                                              Thanks for all the help! - (Regards to the Concerned)
