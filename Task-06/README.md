## Task 06 - Geddit
I actually freaked out after seeing the task, as it seemed a bit tough. But just as I went through the resources given in tasks doc, everything became pretty simple. Almost most of the code was given in <a href="https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit">this</a> repo. I just had to logically combine and frame my code which I understood after going through the examples.

I just used 'week' as the time parameter with the search query for the subreddit as 'memes' and luckily as per the task we were to fetch and upvote 100 posts which I found out to be the exact number of posts we could fetch in a single go.

On a side note, I for some reason wasn't able to Authorize my Reddit App using curl, but the IPython Method came handy. Anyways, I have uploaded screenshots in the images folder, feel free to verify.
